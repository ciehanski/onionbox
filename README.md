# onionbox [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ciehanski/onionbox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ciehanski/onionbox)

A basic implementation of [OnionShare](https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare) in Go.
Mostly built as a fun project, onionbox is still a WIP so usage is not guaranteed secure, *yet*.

#### Key Features:
- All files are stored in memory and *never* written to disk. The bytes from
each uploaded file are written to an individual **zip buffer** (in memory, and also compressed ðŸ˜„) and then written directly
to the response for download. Zip was chosen since it is the most universal archiving
standard that is supported by all operating systems.
- You have the ability to encrypt the uploaded files' bytes if
the content is extra sensitive. GCM is used for encryption. This means, while stored in memory, the files' bytes
will be encrypted as well. **If password encryption is enabled, recipients will need to enter the correct password during 
the download process or the presented zip archive will be corrupt.**
- You have the ability to limit the number of downloads per download link
generated.
- You have the ability to enforce that download links automatically expire after a specific duration of your choosing.
- Universal file-sharing. For instance, if you are the recipient of confidential information 
but the sender is not technically-savvy, you yourself can run an onionbox server, send them the 
generated .onion URL and have them upload the files directly for you to download.
- Can be run in a Docker container, or locally on your host machine. You could
of course deploy onionbox to any cloud provider of your choosing.
- Static binary! Woo! Possible ARM support.

## Gotchas:
- There is no getting around it, this project takes a little over 10 minutes to
build. However, this will not be an issue for end users once we have the binaries
released. It will always take a millennium to build in Docker.

## TODO:
- [ ] Implement tests
- [x] Use flags for config options
- [x] Serve files from buffer instead of disk
- [x] Implement download limits  
- [x] Implement password protected files
- [x] Implement checksums
- [ ] Implement my own name generator to remove dependency on [randomdata](https://github.com/Pallinder/go-randomdata).
All other dependencies are required to interface with Tor.
- [x] Static build
- [x] Docker build
- [ ] Get docker-compose working with a dnscrypt-proxy. Maybe overkill or moot
but sounds cool as hell, right?
- [ ] ARM support?

## Shoutouts:

Huge shoutout to [@karalabe](https://github.com/karalabe), the creator of [go-libtor](https://github.com/ipsn/go-libtor) which enables the 
creation of a Go-friendly static Tor executable which utilizes [bine](https://github.com/cretz/bine) (created by [@cretz](https://github.com/cretz))
to interface with the Tor API. Big thanks to these guys or this project would not be possible.
